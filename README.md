## About

### The project

Forkify is a web app realized using js, scss and HTML. The goal is to let users search for their favourite recipes, bookmark them, market ingredients, plan some cooking and add their own recipes.
I tried my best to make the app suitable for both desktop and mobile devices and smaller screens!

```

 npm i

```
